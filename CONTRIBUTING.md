# Contribute

This article explains how to contribute to the SaxoBank code sample repository.
Please read through the following guidelines.

## Contributions

There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.
If you have questions, see [support](SUPPORT.md).

### Improve docs

As a user you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
It’s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.

## Submitting an issue

* The issue tracker is for issues.
* Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new issue.
* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue, error message, version, operating system, etcetera.
* The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you.

## Submitting a pull request

* Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work.
* For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the community for feedback as soon as possible.
* Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request.
