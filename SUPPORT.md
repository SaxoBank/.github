Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
Here are some tips:

* Try to define what you need help with:
  * Is there something in particular you want to do?
  * What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  * Is there a concept you donâ€™t understand?
* Provide sample code, such as a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) or video, if possible.
* Screenshots can help, but if thereâ€™s important text such as code or error messages in them, please also provide those as text.
* Provide your UserId, ClientId and AccountId. Provide the name of your app and the environment you are using (SIM/Live).
* Provide the [X-Correlation header](https://openapi.help.saxo/hc/en-us/articles/4434784593309), when applicable.
* The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you.
